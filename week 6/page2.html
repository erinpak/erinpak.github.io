                around 4.5 billion years ago, our solar system was formed when a nearby star exploded.
                the resulting <em>supernova</em> made waves in space, squeezing together the clouds of gas and dust to create the sun.
                materials not absorbed into the sun swirled around it, held by the orbit of the sun's gravity.
                eventually, atoms and molecules began to stick together to slowly create <em>planets</em>.
