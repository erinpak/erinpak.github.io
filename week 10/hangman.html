            In the reading, McLuhan argues that technology IS the message,
            rather than just a medium of communicating messages, and that
            technology helps us to percieve the world in its own unique way.

            The reading was a bit hard for me to understand at first, but I
            understood it better with the hangman game example. In this example,
            the content of the message - the word you are trying to guess - is
            not really that relevant or meaningful. However, the context and functionality
            for the game, such as having a set number of tries before something
            terrible happens -the man getting hanged- says a lot more about the 
            message of the game than its content does. The technology of the
            hangman game, rather than the content you must guess itself, communicates
            a clearer message about the dark and hostile nature of the game that
            uses punishment as a motivator for the user to win.
