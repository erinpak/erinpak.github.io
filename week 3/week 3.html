             <h2>1. "As We May Think" <em>by Vannevar Bush</em></h2>
             <p>The article “As We May Think” was published in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, who talks about the role of science and technology in American society after World War II. Bush brings up his idea of a potential machine called the “memex,” which he describes as a “future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library.” The purpose of this device would be to spread knowledge to be easily accessible by all. While reading this, I couldn’t help but think that he predicted the future because of the memex’s similarities to the Internet, which has grown to allow knowledge to become very accessible due to the widespread usage of smartphones.

             <h2>2. "Long Live the Web <em>by Tim Berners-Lee</em>"</h2>
            <p>“Long Live the Web,” an article by Tim Berners-Lee published in the Scientific American in December 2010 talking about how we need to protect the Web’s democracy. I really enjoyed this reading because I agree with his thoughts on how the Web is an essential public space for freedom of speech and a platform for democracy. I think the most interesting parts from this article were when the author basically exposed multiple big-name corporations, such as Facebook and Google, and governments for their various threats on the Web’s universality, from selling user data to fighting against net neutrality.</p>
